# textome

text analysis software

This is a rewrite from scratch of some text analysis software I wrote earlier this year.
The other software was really hacky so I'm using it as reference while I build this 
repo from scratch.

Below here are some quick dev notes, they are probably a little cryptic, will rewrite later.

Namespaces:
- textome.token
-- This will contain many different types of text tokenizers. Future functionality: ability to compose tokenizers into more powerful/abstract ones.

- textome.ngram (moved to standalone library, may reintegrate into this.)


Roadmap coming soon... 

first steps (roadmap coming soon...)

1. tokenize
2. ngrams

## Usage

Pre alpha, no tutorial currently. sorry.
